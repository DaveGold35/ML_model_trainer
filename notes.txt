need to remember to check the filetypes for data uploads

also to add a description to be stored with every job.

add comment to say to make target variable in the last column of data

K-MEANS CLUSTERING
When computing the correct number of cluster for K-Means:
Two possible ways to check if the number of cluster is correct
    
    1. Elbow Method:
        1. K-means for diff values of k
        2. for each k, calculate the total within-cluster sum of squares(wss)
        3. Plot the curve of WSS according to the number of clusters of k
        4. The location of the bend (knee) in the plot is generally considered as an indicator of the appropriate number of clusters.\

    2. Average silhouette method:
        1. K-means for diff values of k
        2. For each k, calculate the average silhouette of observations (avg. sil)?
        3. plot the curve of avg.sil according to the number of clusters k
        4. the location of the maximum is considered as the appropriate number of clusters.
